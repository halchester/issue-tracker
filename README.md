### About this repo ❗️

This repo is for the purpose of learning next + tailwind css. After finishing this project, I really think tailwind css is something to have a skillset on and I'd really love to use it again in my next projects.

### Tools that i use 🚀

- Next js
- Tailwind css
- Express
- Mongo

### Other packages that i rely on ✨

- axios (for sending HTTP requests)
- formik (for handling forms in react)
- moment (for timestamps)
- react-query (a great package to replace useEffect in react)
